The home page contains a header and footer. The logo in the header has a link that leads to the main page.
The navigation bar buttons have links to the pages of the same name. When you hover, the scale increases and the color changes, border appears. In the active state of border, the scale and color remain.

The basis of the text of the page briefly tells what kind of web page it is, and also shows my photo.
